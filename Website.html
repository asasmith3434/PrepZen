        <h1> What Makes Zen Garden Interesting? </h1>
<p1>
   Zen Garden introduces the viewers to a new way of looking at the development of Web
    design. It focusus on CSS and it's efforts to help improve the capabilities when 
    designing the Web. The field of Web design is personally very new to me, and 
    Zen Garden proved to be an inspiration for someone with no prior experience 
    in CSS.

  Favorite CSS design!

      My favorite format of Zen Garden is Verde Moderna. It is the first one which is presented to the viewer but I can see why, becasue it's the most captivating. Verde Moderna's format fits well with the theme of the site, Zen Garden.the The page itself reads very smoothly and the layout it quiet advanced, where the page flows perfectly and is very appealing to the eye. Furthermore, the page is created so that the viewer gets to decide what format they wish to review the site in, or which CSS file will be implemented to fit your needs.
